# Live app (`index.html`) — integration & change queue

Everything to apply to the LIVE app (`rounds-codex-app` repo → https://rounds-codex.netlify.app)
in the **desktop + Chrome** session. All edits are built/verified here first, then published in
ONE integrated pass: pull the current live `index.html` once → apply all of the below → verify
headless → upload to `main` via Chrome → Netlify auto-deploys.

> The live `index.html` is NOT in this workspace (private repo, firewalled). Pull the newest copy
> from `github.com/kreithen/rounds-codex-app` (`main`, via Chrome → Raw) before editing so nothing
> already live gets reverted.

## Layout / functionality changes
### 1. Home-page tagline text
- **Change:** `KNOWLEDGE. CLARITY. BETTER OUTCOMES` → `LEARN. UNDERSTAND. SUCCEED`
- **Scope:** text content ONLY — keep the exact same font, size, weight, letter-spacing, and
  color (do not touch any CSS/classes; only replace the words).
- **How:** grep the live `index.html` for the tagline (match the actual on-page form — it may be
  upper/mixed case, split across spans, or use `&middot;`/`.` separators) and replace just the
  three words, preserving whatever markup/separators wrap them. If it's three separate elements,
  replace each word in place (LEARN / UNDERSTAND / SUCCEED).
- **Verify:** tagline reads "LEARN. UNDERSTAND. SUCCEED" with identical styling; nothing else moved.

<!-- More layout/functionality changes get appended here as the user sends them. -->

## Content integrations (built & staged in this repo)
- **USMLE Mode** — wire the finished quiz app (`preview/`) into `index.html` (new section/route,
  TBD with user). 705+ items across Step 1/2 CK/3 Day 1/3 Day 2.
- **Cardiology galleries (5)** — `galleries-staging/*-gallery.pdf` via the `medcodex-gallery`
  builder; titles pre-drafted in `galleries-staging/*-titles.json` (confirm visually).
- **Cardiology quizzes (3)** — pre-parsed to `galleries-staging/*-quiz.json`; wire into the
  Aortic / DVT / Cardiac-Arrest condition pages (confirm the app's quiz format first).
- **Resident Mode expansion** — replace embedded `RES_DATA` with the 1308-entry master +
  wiring from `resident-staging/` (data expansion, NOT a first-time patch — see its DEPLOY-README).

## Publish
Upload updated `index.html` (+ any new `assets/<id>/` for galleries) to `main` via Chrome; confirm
Netlify deploy goes green; load the live site and verify each change.
